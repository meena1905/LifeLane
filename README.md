# LifeLane
**LifeLane - Smart Emergency Traffic System**
__Introduction__
LifeLane is a project designed to solve the problem of ambulances getting stuck at traffic signals. The system uses real-time tracking to detect ambulances and automatically triggers green lights in their path, ensuring quicker passage and reducing emergency delays.

__Problem__
Ambulances often face delays at traffic signals, especially in busy areas. These delays can be critical, affecting the lives of people in need of urgent medical attention.

__Features__
- Live Traffic Monitoring: Tracks traffic signals and ambulance movement in real-time.
- Active Ambulance Display: Shows the status of active ambulances.
- Smart Signal Control: Automatically changes traffic signals to allow ambulances to pass without delay.

__Technology Used__
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for styling and layout.
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js for handling server requests.
- Mapping API: OpenStreetMap for location tracking and mapping.

__Future Improvements__
- AI Traffic Prediction: Use AI algorithms to predict traffic patterns and optimize signal timings.
- IoT Integration: Implement smart traffic lights connected to the system for real-time control.
- Global Mapping Support: Integrate additional mapping services for wider global compatibility.
